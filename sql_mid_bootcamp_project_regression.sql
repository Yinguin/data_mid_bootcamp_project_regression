#### 1. Creating new database ####
CREATE DATABASE house_price_regression;


#### 2. Creating table house_price_data ####
USE house_price_regression;

CREATE TABLE house_price_data (
    house_id BIGINT NOT NULL,

#### 3. Importing data from .csv file ####
# Either we can use the data import wizard or the following methods:

#SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';		# to check if local_infile is off/on.
#SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;	# If local_infile is off, to set it to on.
#SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv'; # To see the setting of the secure_file_priv, if NULL then no restriction.

# The file my.ini was altered and "secure-file-priv" was given an empty ("") value to allow the following query.
# The file regression_data.csv was copied to the same folder in order to be accessible using this query.
LOAD DATA INFILE 'regression_data.csv' 	
INTO TABLE house_price_data
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

## The table does not have a primary key, which could be an issue, so the sales will be indexed and the index will play the role of the table's primary key.
ALTER TABLE house_price_data
ADD sales_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
	ADD PRIMARY KEY (sales_id);

## After the primary key was added, its relative position in relation to the table will be changed to first.
ALTER TABLE house_price_data
MODIFY COLUMN sales_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT

#### 4. Checking if data was imported correctly ####
SELECT

## Instead the column will be standardised and its datatype will be fixed.
